# Welcome to my github 👋🏼

I am a Final-Year undergraduate student at University College London (@UCL) studying Earth Sciences in the Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Scieces. My interest in the world of programming started in my first year whereby Matlab was a compulsory module. Fascinated how direct and powerful coding was, I eventually followed coursed in Java and Python with Microsoft. The more I learned, the deeper my I dove into the subject, experimenting with data mining and artificial intelligence.

# My Coding Background 🐍 
After my first year, I interned at INNODIS Limited in Mauritius whereby I was allocated of creating a real time open source software from scratch using Python in 6 weeks. It was quite challenging but I was very satisfied with the result and started considering a career that was not as focused on the environment and environmental consulting. During my second year, we were assigned term projects that required us to use python to model climate in various parts of the world and potential scenarios when changing different climatic variables. As of then, I have been interested in a career course that both combines my scientific background and my applied knowledge in programming and modelling.
